Overall, this data suggests that total budget alone is not a good predictor of success in regards to reading and math scores. Instead, spending less money per student and being a small or medium sized school are the best indicators for success.

According to this data set, charter schools outperform district schools. However, further analysis is warranted to determine if this can be attributed to fundamental differences between schools or to the fact that charter schools typically have less students or to something else altogether.

A larger school population seems to be an accurate predictor for poor test scores, as the average test scores are dramatically lower for those schools than for small and medium sized schools.
